# Computational Forensics 
Term Paper and Code of Authorship Analysis Project from Computational Forensics Course in Fall Semester 2023, UZH.

From Course Catalogue:
Forensic linguistics is the application of linguistic methods to forensic contexts: be it in law, crime investigation or cybercrime detection.
Tasks are, among others, author (including speaker) identification and profiling (age, gender, ..), plagiarism detection (e.g. style change), 
the screening of social media accounts for problematic content (e.g. hateful, pedophlic). Stylometry is crucial here as well,
e.g. a particular syntactic style might be indicative of the writer.
Computational linguistics methods (statistical methods, machine Learning) can be used to carry out this kind of analysis.
With the rise of large language models like ChatGPT, another interessting task has evolved: predicting whether the author of a text is human or some "artificial intelligence". This also will be covered.
